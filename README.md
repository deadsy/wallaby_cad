CAD files for the Wallaby Engine

## Scaling

These CAD files are the size of the original plans.
I wanted a larger engine and so scaled each linear dimension by 1.25

Engine Build = 1.25
Pattern Scaling = (1.25/0.98) = 1.276

Carburetor Build = sqrt(1.25^3) = 1.398
Pattern Scaling = (1.398/0.98) = 1.426

 * Al casting shrinkage = 0.98
 * Fuel volume requirements are a function of engine volume while carburetor delivery capability is a function of bore area.
